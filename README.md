Funkify

Funkify is a dynamic whiteboard drawing website inspired by skribble.io. It allows multiple users to collaborate in real time, drawing and erasing on the same whiteboard.
Features

    Real-time collaboration: Multiple users can draw and erase on the same whiteboard at the same time.
    Immersive and interactive drawing experience: Funkify uses a comprehensive tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to deliver an immersive and interactive drawing experience.
    Extensible: Funkify is extensible, allowing users to add their own custom shapes, colors, and tools.

Getting Started

To get started with Funkify, you can clone the GitHub repository and run the following commands:

npm install
npm start

This will start the Funkify server on port 3000. You can then open a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to start drawing.

Future Scope

    Add more drawing tools: Funkify could add more drawing tools, such as shapes, text, and images. This would allow users to create more complex and expressive drawings.
    Improve the collaboration experience: Funkify could improve the collaboration experience by adding features such as chat, undo/redo, and history. This would make it easier for users to collaborate on drawings and keep track of changes.
    Make Funkify more accessible: Funkify could be made more accessible by adding features such as keyboard navigation and high contrast mode. This would make it easier for people with disabilities to use Funkify.
    Release Funkify as a mobile app: Funkify could be released as a mobile app, making it easier for people to use on their phones and tablets.

These are just a few ideas for the future of Funkify. I'm sure there are many other ways to improve the project. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Funkify!

Here are some additional ideas for the future scope of Funkify:

    Add a commenting feature: This would allow users to leave comments on drawings, which would be helpful for providing feedback and collaborating on projects.
    Add a sharing feature: This would allow users to share their drawings with others, either publicly or privately.
    Add a monetization feature: This would allow Funkify to generate revenue, which could be used to improve the project or pay for hosting costs.
